# Deploy from Cursor to GitHub

Quick scripts to commit and push your changes to `origin/main`.

## Windows CMD

Run:

```
scripts\deploy.cmd "feat: my change"
```

If no message is provided, a timestamped message will be generated.

## PowerShell

Run:

```
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\deploy.ps1 -Message "feat: my change"
```

## Notes

- First push will prompt you to authenticate in your browser.
- Remote is set to `https://github.com/Maomao-2004/Guardientry.git` if missing.
- Branch is forced to `main` for consistency.
